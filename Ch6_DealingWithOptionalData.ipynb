    "<b>Representing optional data in computer programs has always been a problem</b>. The concept of optional data is very simple in everyday life. Representing the absence of something when this something is contained in a container is easy—whatever it is, it can be represented by an empty container. An absence of apples can be represented by an empty apple basket. The absence of gasoline in a car can be visualized as an empty gas tank. Representing the absence of data in computer programs is more difficult. Most data is represented as a reference pointing to it, so the most obvious way to represent the absence of data is to use a pointer to nothing. This is what a null pointer is. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, a variable is a pointer to a value. Variables may be created <b><a href='https://docs.python.org/2/library/constants.html#None'>None</a></b> , and they may then be changed to point to values. They can even be changed again to point to null if data is removed. To handle optional data, in this chapter, you’ll develop the class called <b><font color=\"blue\">Option</font></b>. The goal of this chapter is to learn how this kind of structure works in handling optional data.\n",
    "\n",
    "# <font color='blue'>Problems with the null pointer</font>\n",
    "One of the most frequent bugs in imperative programs is the <font color='blue'><b>AttributeError</b></font>. This error is raised when an identifier is dereferenced and found to be pointing to nothing. In other words, some data is expected but is found missing. Such an identifier is said to be pointing to null. The null reference was invented in 1965 by Tony Hoare while he was designing the ALGOL object-oriented language. Here’s what he said 44 years later:\n"

    "The <b><font color='blue'>Option</font></b> data type you’ll create in this chapter will be very similar to the List data type. Using an <b><font color='blue'>Option</font></b> type for optional data allows you to compose functions even when the data is absent (<font color='brown'>see figure 6.1</font>). It will be implemented as an abstract class, <b><font color='blue'>Option</font></b>, containing two private subclasses representing the presence and the absence of data. The subclass representing the absence of data will be called <b><font color='blue'>N</font></b> (<font color='brown'>Stands for None</font>), and the subclass representing the presence of data will be called Some. A Some will contain the corresponding data value.\n",

    "```python\n",
    "Of course, people will do what they want. But we did have a clear intention when adding this feature, and it was not to be a general purpose Maybe or Some type, as much as many people would have liked us to do so. Our intention was to provide a limited mechanism for library method return types where there needed to be a clear way to represent “no result” and using null for such was overwhelmingly likely to cause errors. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you probably should never use it for something that returns an array of results, or a list of results; instead return an empty array or list. You should almost never use it as a field of something or a method parameter. I think routinely using it as a return value for getters would definitely be over-use. There’s nothing wrong with Optional that it should be avoided, it’s just not what many people wish it were, and accordingly we were fairly concerned about the risk of zealous over-use. \n",
    "````\n",
    "This is a very important answer that deserves some reflection. First of all, and this might be the most important part, “people will do what they want.” Nothing to add here. Just do what you want. This doesn’t mean you should do whatever you want without thinking. But feel free to try every solution that comes to mind. You shouldn’t refrain from using Optional in a particular way just because it wasn’t intended to be used that way. Imagine the first man who ever thought about grabbing a stone to hit something with more strength. He had two options (pun intended!): refraining from doing it because stones had obviously not been intended to be used as hammers, or just trying it. \n",

    "## <font color='green'>When to use getOrThrow </font>\n",
    "<b>The correct advice is to avoid getOrThrow as much as possible. As a rule of thumb, each time you find yourself using this method outside of the <font color='blue'>Option</font> class, you should consider whether there’s another way to go</b>. Using <font color='blue'>getOrThrow</font> is exiting the functional safety of the <font color='blue'><b>Option</b></font> class. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most important point is the original question: should getters return <font color='blue'><b>Option</b></font>? Generally, they shouldn’t, because properties should be final and initialized at declaration or in constructors, so there’s absolutely no need for getters to return <font color='blue'><b>Option</b></font>. (<font color='brown'>I must admit, however, that initializing fields in constructors doesn’t guarantee that access to properties is impossible before they’re initialized. This is a marginal problem that’s easily solved by making classes final, if possible.</font>) \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>But some properties might be optional.</b> For example, a person will always have a first name and a last name, but they might have no email. How can you represent this? By storing the property as an <font color='blue'><b>Option</b></font>. In such cases, the getter will have to return an <font color='blue'><b>Option</b></font>. Saying that “routinely using it as a return value for getters would definitely be over-use” is like saying that a property without a value should be set to null, and the corresponding getter should return null. This completely destroys the benefit of having <font color='blue'><b>Option</b></font>. \n",
    "\n",
    "What about methods that take <font color='blue'><b>Option</b></font> as their argument? In general, this should not occur. To compose methods returning <font color='blue'><b>Option</b></font>, you shouldn’t use methods that take <font color='blue'><b>Option</b></font> as their argument. For example, to compose the two following methods, you don’t need to change the methods to make them accept <font color='blue'><b>Option</b></font> as their argument: \n",
